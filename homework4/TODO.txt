1) Plot training data 
     labels
2) Plot testing data
     labels
3 ) Perceptron learning on training data
	   vary:
		eta
		initial weight distributions
		ordering of presentations
		
	   calculate:
		error over epochs
		how may epochs it takes to converge

4) Apply learned values on testing data simulatneously
      	   calculate:
		error over epochs for generalization graphs

6) Analayze and explain what you see

7) Redo 3-5 for Delta-Rule (LMS) algorithm


All must be done in pdf form -- use R?
